# Spellcheck Common Misspellings using co:here API
The repo shows off an application of co:here Language API where it can learn to do a multitude of tasks such as spelling and word correction!

## Details
This repo contains multiple files. Each of them is the same example but showing off the example in different lanugages. The advantage to using co:here is to make it much easier to integrate into products as it just an API call away from being used. You can even adapt the API calls such as what I did here to hint at what the call should be attempting to resolve.

In this case I passing in samples of my own misspellings: feild -> field, and paralel -> parallel. After passing in a few samples I give the API a sample that does not have its Corrected Text finished. It will then return the anwnser. The returned Corrected Text will have the typo fixed! Amazing!

Considering the task at hand, this is why AI as an API is catching on as much of the overhead of using AI is passed off the the company who designed the model. This allows businesses to focus on using the model isntead of develoiping the model.
